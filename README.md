# COVID-19 Self-reporting Tool web content

Just some static content for the tool itself.

## Instructions

### In-browser editing
This is the simplest approach for editing files. For a variety of reasons (auto-formatting, syntax highlighting, error/format checking, etc.) it is still preferable to do your **editing in VS Code** and then paste them in.

1. Click the file you want to edit (e.g. *privacy-policy.html*).
1. Click the **pencil icon** on right side.
1. Edit the text directly or overwrite entirely, whatever is easiest.
1. Enter a short-yet-meaningful **commit message** that your Future Selfâ„¢ will understand. Each message shows up in the [commit log](https://github.com/abettermap/c19-self-report-content/commits/master) similar to the "Revisions" list in Google Docs, for example.
1. Click the `Commit changes` button.
1. ðŸŽ‰ 

### Standard Git workflow

If the above is getting tedious, ask about a faster approach.
