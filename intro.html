    The COVID-19 Self-Reporting Tool is an open source project that allows
    anyone, anywhere suspecting COVID-19 exposure to add their case to an open
    access public database that can be visualized on a heatmap. In the near
    future the heatmap will extend two weeks into the future, allowing users to
    visualize future
    <a href="/models">predictions</a> of COVID-19 case loads in their area.

    As scientists we understand that data are critical for developing a true and
    realistic understanding of COVID-19. Moved by the grave pandemic facing all
    of us, we felt it was our duty as individuals with advanced training in the
    sciences to come together and create a tool that fills the gaps in our
    knowledge for COVID-19.

    One of the major problems facing our global community at this time is the
    lack of testing. Presently, most countries only offer testing to individuals
    in critical condition or those who are hospitalized. Because of this, many
    individuals aren't being tested for COVID-19 and official global data on the
    number of people infected with the virus, and the viral spread is inaccurate
    and misleading.
  </p>
  <p>
    Motivated by this problem we have come together to combine our skills and
    create a tool that will create more transparency on the spread of COVID-19
    and provide the data we need to overcome this pandemic as a global
    community.

  <p>
    In early March, one of us began feeling unusual symptoms which sounded
    somewhat like those described for COVID-19. She was denied a test on 5
    occasions. This was frustrating, and being a physicist she realized that
    global data available on the contagion's true spread was limited by testing
    and thus not accurate. How could we stop a virus we didn't understand? While
    she struggled to get a test, she reached out to a few friends, physicists
    and computer scientists, about the issue. Soon we came together as a team
    and the idea for this open source, open data, crowdsourced tool was born.
    All of us have full time jobs and have been volunteering on evenings and
    weekends to build this open source platform for global good.
